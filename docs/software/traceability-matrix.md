This matrix maps the [Software Requirements Specification](./requirements.md)
to the [Software Architecture](./architecture.md),
[Implementation Specification](./specification.md), planned tests, experiment
gates, and paper evidence. `specified` means that a mapping exists; it does not
mean the implementation, test, run, artifact, figure, or claim exists.

## 3. Experiment Gates to Publication Evidence

| Gate | Required retained artifacts | Planned figure/table dependency | Eligible claim only after pass | Current status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E0 | source/split manifests, compact ROOT, canonical HDF5, preprocessing policy, data/yield/leakage/cost audit | T1 dataset and audit summary; Methods data pipeline | The selected CMS 2015 corpus can support the frozen downstream protocol | `specified` |
| E0.5 | checkpoint identity, license and corpus record, index hashes, layer-load report, A-D finite smoke results, tiny-loss trace | Methods model integration; reproducibility appendix | The same pretrained backbone is defensibly adapted across A-D, or the claim is explicitly narrowed | `specified` |
| E1 | A/D pilot run records, aligned predictions, metrics, timing/memory/storage, budget | pilot diagnostics are not primary paper results | The clean-command pipeline and resource projection are adequate for E2 | `specified` |
| E2 | complete A-D/scale/seed ledger, successful and failed records, predictions, paired statistics | F1, F2, T2, T3 | RQ1/RQ2 results under the frozen protocol | `specified` |
| E3 | Deep Sets/PFN A/D records and paired statistics; optional random-initialization records | F3, T4 | Feature ranking robustness beyond the primary measurement system | `specified` |

## 4. Planned Paper Evidence Definitions

| ID | Planned evidence | Inputs | Integrity constraint | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | Dataset, split, yield, missingness, and cost summary | E0 audits and manifests | Values are generated from retained audits, not copied by hand | `specified` |
| F1 | AUC and background rejection versus training size for A-D | E2 schema-valid runs | Show every seed and uncertainty convention | `specified` |
| F2 | Paired A-B, B-C, C-D, C-A, and D-A deltas | aligned E2 predictions | Exact test identity equality and paired bootstrap required | `specified` |
| T2 | Complete core condition matrix | all E2 run records | Failed/missing conditions remain visible | `specified` |
| T3 | Data-efficiency summary | E2 scale predictions | Use frozen `n_max`; replace unstable ratio with raw differences | `specified` |
| F3 | Seed and baseline robustness comparison | E2 plus required E3 baseline | Do not generalize beyond tested conditions | `specified` |
| T4 | Checkpoint, adapter, environment, and reproducibility appendix | E0.5 audits and all formal run records | Mutable nicknames without hashes are prohibited | `specified` |

The permitted high-level manuscript framing is a dataset-record-disjoint
cross-corpus adaptation study under controlled feature availability. It is not
an unseen-class, cross-detector, universal causal feature-importance, or broad
foundation-model-superiority claim.

## 5. Maintenance Rules

- Every active requirement ID must appear exactly once in Section 2.
- A test or artifact path in this matrix may be planned; its status must remain
  `specified` until repository evidence exists.
- `implemented` requires an identified code/document artifact.
- `verified` requires an identified passing automated check or retained gate
  artifact.
- A failed or deferred upstream item prevents stronger downstream status.
- Changes to research questions, endpoints, `n_max`, dataset, labels, or split
  require the corresponding Research Plan v0.4.x amendment before this matrix
  is updated.
